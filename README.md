## How do I use this?

Currently, you've to setup the application locally since we provide no hosted alternatives (coming soon!). Follow the steps below:
#### ü¶ÑLocal Setup
#### 1. **Clone the repository**

````
git clone https://github.com/robinroy03/easyEdits.git
````
#### 2. **Open the folder /backend and install the requirements**
Do this when you're inside the folder `easyEdits/backend`
```
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate       (if you're on windows)
source venv/bin/activate    (if you're on mac/linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 3. **Open the folder /frontend and install the requirements**
Do this when you're inside the folder `easyEdits/frontend`
```
npm i
```
#### 4. **Download FFmpeg**
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

MacOS: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-mac

#### 5. **Setup the Environment Variables**
Add a `.env` file inside `/backend` with the following content
```
GEMINI_API_KEY = your_gemini_api_key
```
Get Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](http://aistudio.google.com/) for free.

#### ü§©How to run the software
You need to have 2 terminals running parallelly with the following commands, one is for frontend and the other for backend.

To run frontend, go to `/frontend` folder and do
```
npm run dev
```
To run backend, go to `/backend` folder and do
```
fastapi dev main.py
```

Now the app will be functional on `http://localhost:5173/`. if it's not, check the URL on the frontend terminal.
